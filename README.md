# Is-forecasting-crypto-e.g.-ETH-returns-possible-
This .py project tries, with the help of various econometrics techniques, estimating and forecasting future ETH returns out-of-sample and in a rolling window configuration. Crucial to this process is the use of other correlated data and the development of a GARCH-T rolling window forecasting out-of-sample algorithm.
